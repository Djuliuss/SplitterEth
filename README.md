# Splitter
First smart contract implementation. 

Upon loading up, the website will show the first five accounts recovered from the network and show its balances in ether.

Button "Split" allows to split a amount of ether between any two accounts. Upon pressing the button, the balance of the Splitter contract will be updated accordingly. 

Button "Withdraw" will withdraw the funds from the Splitter contract and send them to the account.

Have fun!
